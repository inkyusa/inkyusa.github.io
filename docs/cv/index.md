# Research interests
My research interests mostly lie in the development of novel approaches for Field Robotics to solve challenging tasks in real-world environments. A particular focus of my research has been on enabling ground robots to perform autonomous search and rescue mission in subterranean scenarios, as part of the DARPAâ€™s Subt challenge. This autonomy can be achieved by deploying techniques such as multimodal sensing, deep reinforcement learning, sensor fusion techniques for precise state estimation, and model-based robust control.
